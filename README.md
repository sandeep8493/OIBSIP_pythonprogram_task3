# Weather App

A simple weather application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that fetches real-time weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

## Features
- Search weather by city name
- Displays:
  - ðŸŒ¡ Temperature (Â°C)
  - ðŸŒ¥ Weather condition
  - ðŸ’¨ Wind speed
- Responsive and clean user interface

## How It Works
The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on the city name entered by the user.  
It then displays the data directly in the browser without needing any backend.

## Setup
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in the script with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
3. Enter a city name and click **Get Weather**.
